    ## Overview

    The Social Service API powers social interactions and community features within the Decentraland metaverse platform. This API enables users to create and manage communities, connect with friends, participate in voice chats, and engage in social activities.

    ### Key Features

    ### üèòÔ∏è Communities
    - **Create and manage communities** with customizable privacy settings (public/private) and visibility (listed/unlisted)
    - **Member management** with role-based permissions (owner, moderator, member)
    - **Community posts** for sharing updates and announcements
    - **Place associations** to link communities with specific Decentraland locations
    - **Ban management** for community moderation
    - **Invitations and join requests** workflow for private communities

    ### üéôÔ∏è Community Voice Chats
    - Real-time voice chat sessions within communities
    - Role-based participation (speakers and listeners)
    - Active voice chat discovery across communities
    - Location tracking for voice chat participants

    ### üéÅ Referral System
    - Track user referrals and invitations
    - Monitor referral progress and rewards
    - Email association for referral campaigns

    ### üë• Social Features
    - **Friendship management** (via RPC/gRPC - not covered in this REST API)
    - **Blocking and privacy controls** (via RPC/gRPC)
    - **User profiles** with claimed names and avatars
    - **Online status tracking** for community members

    ## Authentication

    This API uses two authentication methods:

    ### Signed Fetch (Primary)
    Most endpoints use **Signed Fetch authentication** (ADR-44), which cryptographically signs requests using the user's Ethereum wallet. This ensures that requests are genuinely from the wallet owner without requiring traditional API keys.

    - **Header**: `Authorization: <signed-fetch-token>`
    - **Required for**: All user-facing endpoints
    - **Optional on**: Public read endpoints (returns additional data when authenticated)
    - **Security**: Prevents scene-based requests for additional security

    ### Bearer Token (Admin)
    Administrative endpoints use **Bearer token authentication** for system-level operations.

    - **Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <API_ADMIN_TOKEN>`
    - **Required for**: Admin and moderation endpoints
    - **Used by**: Backend services and authorized administrators   

    ### Key Concepts

    ### Community Privacy
    - **Public**: Anyone can view and join
    - **Private**: Requires invitation or approval to join

    ### Community Visibility
    - **All** (listed): Appears in public community listings
    - **Unlisted**: Only accessible via direct link, not shown in listings

    ### Community Roles
    - **owner**: Full control over the community
    - **moderator**: Can manage members, posts, and settings
    - **member**: Regular community member
    - **none**: Not a member of the community

    ### Request Types
    - **invite**: An invitation sent to a user to join a community
    - **request_to_join**: A request from a user to join a private community
