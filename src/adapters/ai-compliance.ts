When analyzing thumbnail images, pay special attention to visual content that may violate our Code of Ethics, including inappropriate imagery, violence, discrimination, or other issues that might not be apparent from text alone.

You must respond with a valid JSON object matching the exact structure specified.`

Please evaluate if this community content complies with our ethical standards. Consider:

1. VIOLENCE & HARASSMENT: Does the content promote violence, hate, harassment, bullying, or inappropriate behavior? (Section 4, 9)
2. DISCRIMINATION: Does it contain discriminatory content based on race, sex, marital status, medical condition, or other protected characteristics? (Section 3)

6. LEGAL COMPLIANCE: Does it comply with applicable laws and regulations? (Section 2)
7. CONFIDENTIALITY: Does it expose confidential information or violate privacy? (Section 6)

IMPORTANT: If a thumbnail image is provided, carefully analyze the visual content for any issues of the Code of Ethics. Images can contain inappropriate content that text alone might not reveal.
